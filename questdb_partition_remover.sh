# This script needs both curl and jq installed.
# It will go over all the tables with daily partitioning and will remove all partitions older than 5000 days (change that after you are sure it works as you expect)
# It sends the initial statement to QuestDBâ€™s API and uses jq to parse the JSON output from the REST API.
# Then it extracts the "dataset" element and flatten all the rows.
# Then it reads line by line and calls the QuestDB API with each ALTER TABLE statement.
# Since the output comes quoted with double quotes, before it passes it to the API it trims out the first and last characters (the quotes), using ${sql:1:-1}
